In our proposed work,we have introduced a metric, Noise and Complex structure aligned Validity Index (NCVI) which evaluates clustering quality by combining the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and the Jaccard Index, weighted by parameters α and β. ARI measures the similarity between true and predicted clusters, adjusting for chance, while the Jaccard Index assesses cluster overlap. The parameter α adjusts ARI based on the proportion of outliers, reducing its influence when many data points are not assigned to clusters. This adjustment ensuresthe index remains robust in the presence of noise. The weight β modulates the importance of cluster overlap. Together, these components provide a balanced assessment of clustering validity, addressing both the quality of cluster
